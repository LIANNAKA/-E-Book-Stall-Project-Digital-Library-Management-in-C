# E-Book Stall Project | Digital Library Management in C
Designed and implemented a digital library system in C, streamlining book management with essential functionalities like borrowing, returning, searching, and adding books (up to 50). Focused on efficient data handling using structured programming principles.

## Tech Stack: C, stdio.h, string.h, #define, do-while, switch-case, if-else, for loops, strcmp()

This project strengthened my expertise in structured programming, data management, debugging, and logical problem-solving, providing hands-on experience in building an interactive library system.
